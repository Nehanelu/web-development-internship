			<h1> Hi, I'm Neha</h1>
			
			<p>I am a computer science engineering student at Raj Kumar Goel Institute Of Technology . I am in 2024, I am eager to secure challenging roles as a Web Developer.
				<br>In the second year of my degree, I learn JAVA from Online platform Great Learning. During the course of this I learn the basic concepts of Java programming and the concept of OOPs. I also have knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 and with their help I have made 2 small projects. And this time I am further exploring frontend development for my future. 
				I have little bit knowledge of electronic communication because I have completed my diploma in electronic communication. During my diploma period I have also completed 2 internship and 1 project.
				I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in Web Development.</p>
